# Notes on RESP Accounts üá®üá¶

Disclaimer, these are my learnings over the past couple of years and are only offered to help you on your journey. By reading this, you agree not to sue me. This is not my job, and my intent is simply to help you along your journey.    

I may have missed something, or not talked about every part of the RESP program. During my journey, I have spoken with a first-level CRA agent, an RESP CRA specialist, and someone in the RESP group that manages the government program. I have also learned that most financial advisors come in hot and confident about RESP rules, but I have yet to find a single one that knows as much as I am about to share with you here. It's not the advisor's fault, most do very little with the program or work in the very basics. Some of what I will share touches on topics like "what if I have too much," which yes, does happen.

## Institutions

A financial institution is where you will create and manage your RESP accounts. Commonly your bank can provide an RESP account, but consider that investment banks can as well. Banks (ex: TD) will want you to either hold the funds in cash or one of their mutual funds. Investment banks (ex: Q-trade) will let you invest in the stock market.

## Creating an Account

There are individual and family-type accounts, and each account needs to know who is the subscriber and who are the beneficiaries. Often the parents are the subscribers, but it can be a relative or even a friend. The beneficiary is the child or children to receive the educational funding. An individual account can only have one beneficiary. A family account can have multiple beneficiaries, provided they are siblings. In all cases, the child will require a social security number to be used on all forms related to the accounts.

> You can have an unlimited number of accounts per beneficiary and an unlimited number of accounts by one subscriber.

An account can have one person or two parents as the subscriber referred to as a joint account. This is important for potential tax reasons years later. If for some reason you need to withdraw funds from the account, the taxable funds can ONLY go to the subscriber. There are both good and bad reasons for withdrawing the funds back to the subscriber to be considered. Most often none of these are planned:
* The value in the RESP exceeds what the beneficiaries require.
* The beneficiary has passed away.
* The beneficiary will not be advancing education.

There is nothing stopping you from creating multiple accounts, both individual and family. You can have accounts in different institutions as well. 

A joint subscriber account allows you to distribute the income between two people should you need to take the funds back. Read below on the pain of getting the funds back to the subscriber to better understand why this matters.

## Funds have categories

There are three types of funds within every RESP account. 
1. The contribution, which is what the subscriber adds to the account with after-tax dollars (yes, only after-tax dollars).
2. The Canadian Education Savings Grant (CESG), which is the amount the government adds annually if the subscriber has added funds as well.
3. The investment growth. This is the most interesting part for sure. It is the investment gain you may have achieved.

The government tracks every contribution and grant amount added on an individual basis regardless of the account type. Investment growth in a family account is fully available to every beneficiary without restriction. Contributions and grant amounts associated with one beneficiary cannot be used by another beneficiary, while growth amounts can. This matters when it is time to withdraw funds. 

You can transfer RESP amounts to other RESP accounts in full or partial as much as you like, but only if the beneficiary is on both the sending and receiving accounts. The tracking of contribution and grant values cannot be bypassed, and all restrictions associated follow no matter how much you move the funds around. 

You cannot transfer RESP funds from a single subscriber account to a joint subscriber account or to an account of a different subscriber. Changing who the subscriber is, is not allowed ever for any of it. Ever.

## Contributing Funds

Each beneficiary has a maximum of $50,000 total contribution they are allowed across all of their RESP accounts. That is a hard limit per kid. Contributions made are matched by the government as a grant of 20% of what you contribute to a maximum of $500. For example, 
* if you contribute $0, the grant for that year is $0.
* if you contribute $500, the grant for that year is $100.
* if you contribute $2,500, the grant for that year is $500.
* if you contribute $5,000, the grant for that year is $500 which is the limit.

## Withdrawing Funds for Education

This is the exciting time for both the subscribers and the beneficiary as they start a new chapter in their lives with advanced education. Starting classes there are expenses, bills to pay, sports, activity fees, laptops to buy. Tuition is sometimes paid upfront but often delayed payment requirements by weeks which helps. Surprise, you do not get access to the funds all at once and certainly not all of your funds. To start the process will require proof of enrollment from the educational institution, and will be required every time a withdrawal is made.

> This is where some people start not liking the RESP program depending on how much you have accumulated over the years.

There are different ways to withdraw funds from an RESP, for now, we will focus on the methods common to this life stage. The government wants to ensure you actually attend class to receive the funds, so in the first 13 weeks you only have access to $8,000 for full-time students and $4,000 for part-time. Surprise!

After the 13-week probation, and the beneficiary is still enrolled, access to the RESP opens up, sort of, almost, but yes. Let's first look at how to get the funds out. Remember the three fund categories? The contributions went in as after-tax dollars and yes, it comes out as after-tax dollars. To withdraw the contributions is called the PSE (Post Secondary Education). To withdraw the grant funds is called the EAP (Educational Assistance Payment) which is taxable income to the beneficiary. The remaining investment growth is withdrawn as EAP and is taxable income.

> There is a limit annually but not really a limit but good luck with that.

There is plenty of documentation both government and 3rd party that claims there is no limit on withdrawing from your RESP accounts. Not true, sort of. While there is no limit, there is a barrier preventing more than $28,881 (as of 2025) for the year.

[Click here for the official table](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/registered-plans-administrators/bulletins/resp-bulletin-1.html).

To withdraw more than the annual limit requires you asking for permission to access more. Here is where it gets weird. The government put the policing responsibility on the institution that holds your RESP account. That institution decides if you are justified in getting the extra cash for your kid based on what you send them in writing, often requiring a budget.

This is a good point to talk about what you can use the funds for and what you cannot. Funds can be used for tuition, books, electronics, food, rent, transportation, clothes, and general living. They cannot be used to buy property, a vacation, or a bunch of other things the CRA likely adjusts from time to time. The beneficiary can purchase a car and pay for fuel, parking, and insurance. This is important because while it is extremely unlikely any beneficiary using the annual limit will get audited by the CRA, it is more likely to occur if you go beyond it. Going beyond the limit is allowed and considered "unlimited" but must be justified and policed by the financial institution. If you get audited, you can bet the financial institution is going to draw the CRA's attention as well, so they are not usually motivated to help you.

> Keep your receipts in case of a CRA audit.

If the beneficiary is going to Harvard or somewhere that exceeds the annual limit, justifying and surviving a CRA audit should not be a problem.

## Calling the CRA for Guidance ‚ö†Ô∏è

A strong word of caution about calling the CRA for guidance on RESP accounts. The first line of agents you talk to will honestly try to help you and have the best intentions, but most often will give you bad and incorrect advice. This is because they search pages on canada.ca, apply their thoughts, and respond. Nearly all of the pages on canada.ca about RESPs talk about being unlimited withdrawals which is not true, but sort of true. Ask for the CRA department that deals with RESP accounts specifically! They know what can be done and not done very well and in great detail.

## Summer break funding

Most educational institutions (Universities, Colleges, Trade Schools) take the summer off or lighten the studies during the summer months. It's important as Canadians get our vitamin D. The government recognizes that between terms, like summer, the student does not magically not require food and shelter. If the annual limit is not enough to accommodate for the entire year, put a budget together showing that and require further funds from the RESP.

## Things to ponder on while eating a biscuit

* Invest the RESP funds in a blue-chip stock like Microsoft, Apple, Coke, or Costco. Something that everyone uses and continues to steadily grow. Then sit on it and don't touch it for 10 years while your kid grows up.
* Consider not using RESP much or at all. A growing TFSA is far better considering its tax-free growth.
* Plan ahead if you think it will grow too big over time. Seriously, do things like start with a joint RESP subscriber.
* Withdraw the contribution funds first. Your kid will likely start in September, a partial year, pull the full annual amount out if you have it, it's tax-free.
* Withdraw the maximum amount every year you can, always, even if it is not needed. Start your kid on a TFSA if there are extra funds.
* It is far easier to withdraw the full annual amount in January than little bits over the year.

## Overgrowth

Yes, this can happen and yes this is where you may start to hate the program a little. Let's run a scenario where you get the most out of the program by contributing $2,500 annually to your kid's RESP starting at age 2, all the way to age 17. That is $40,000 of after-tax dollars that you saved from your own income and/or from relatives and friends. Every year, the government will grant your RESP $500 (see above section about contribution funds for details), totaling $3,000 added each year. Let's say you invested all that money in the NASDAQ Index fund. It represents all stocks in the NASDAQ and has averaged 14% growth over the past decade as of 2025. After completing 5 years of post-secondary education, there would be an extra $110,000 still in the RESP account.

Here is an example table to consider.

| AGE | University Year | Contribution | Grant | RESP Balance | Withdraw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | x | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | x | 2,500 | 500 | 3,420 | 0 |

At first, you are thinking how amazing that is, I'll just give that $110,000 to my kid. Nope, you cannot. No No No. Not that easy. The government demands its pound of flesh here which we will get into shortly. Geez, imagine this big win, better yet achieving that with 2 kids, 3 kids, or more kids, and how nice it would be to just take that money back.

> The table balances out nicer if you contribute $2,000 annually per kid based on this growth and grant model.

Okay, so why can you not give the money to your kid? Because it's still in the RESP program and your kid has graduated. If they continue studies, great, but let's assume they do not for this example. The following is a list of extraction options we now have to work with:

1. Donate it to the government. It's really an option presented on Canada.ca site. Don't do this ever.
2. Transfer the funds to another sibling so they can use it. Just do it before they turn 19 or it's not allowed. 
3. Transfer up to $50,000 into the subscriber's RRSP account. This is a once in the subscriber's lifetime event. If you have 2 kids, you still can only do this once ever and it is restricted to only go to the subscriber(s) and nobody else. Joint subscribers here does help!
4. Extract funds back to the subscriber(s) as taxable income. That seems reasonable, except the government charges 20% then they charge you income tax after that üò†. This may be the worst tax penalty.

Now you can see why a joint account is better. You can distribute some of the taxes and allow for both subscribers to receive RRSP transfers. Unfortunately, if you set up your RESP accounts under one subscriber it cannot be changed.

Extracting funds back to the subscriber is called AIP (Accumulated Income Payments), including extracting to an RRSP. The RRSP extraction is only allowed if ALL beneficiaries are 21 years or older, no longer in need of education, and the RRSP account has existed for 10+ years. Once an AIP withdrawal happens on an RESP account, that account MUST be closed by the nearest February or all its value gets absorbed by the government üò†. This is a good time to remind you there is no limit on the number of RESP accounts and you can transfer full or partial amounts between them.

Let's get back to unpacking this example. 

We have the $110,360 to work with and off the top there is a 20% fee taken by the government resulting in $88,288. Whatever the subscriber's income is already, add the $88,288 to that amount and adjust your income tax accordingly for your household. Ouch! The funds are now taxed and if you want to give that to your kid, go for it. Just remember to hold back a bunch to support your own tax increase.

You could split that over multiple years to lessen the burden which might be better, just remember to create different RESP accounts to avoid having the government absorb your funds in the next February.

# Wish List to Policy Makers

We can wish, but yeah, it's a government program.

* Allow unlimited transfer from RESP to RRSP, provided the subscriber has room. It all gets taxed anyway on the way. This is one registered program connecting to another registered program.
* Allow subscribers to withdraw their after-tax dollars back to themselves without penalty. It has already been taxed.
