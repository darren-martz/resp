# Notes on RESP Accounts ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

## Institutions

A financial institution is where you will create and manage your RESP accounts. 
Commonly your bank can provide an RESP account, but consider than investment banks can as well. 
Banks (ex: TD) will want you to either hold the funds in cash or one of their mutual funds. 
Investment banks (ex: q-trade) will let you invest in the stock market.

## Creating an Account

There are individual and family type accounts, and each account needs to know who is the subscriber and who are the beneficiaries. 
Often the parents are the subscribers, but it can be a relative or even a friend. 
The beneficiary is the child or children to receive the educational funding.
An individual account can only have one beneficiary. A family account can have multiple beneficiaries, provided they are siblings. 
In all cases the child will require a social security number to be used on all forms related to the accounts.

> You can have an unlimited number of accounts per beneficiary and an unlimited number of accounts by one subscriber

An account can have one person or two parents as the subscriber referred to as a joint account.
This is important for potential tax reasons years later. 
If for some reason you need to withdraw funds from the account, the taxable funds can ONLY go to the subscriber. 
There are both good and bad reasons for withdrawing the funds back to the subscriber to be considered. Most often none of these are planned
* the value in the RESP exceeds what the beneficiaries require
* the beneficiary has passed away
* the beneficiary will not be advancing education

There is nothing stopping you from creating multiple accounts, both individual and family. You can have accounts in different institutions as well. 


## Funds have categories

There are 3 types of funds within every RESP account. 
1. The contribution, which is what the subscriber adds to the account with after tax dollars (yes, only after tax dollars).
2. The Canadian Education Savings Grant (CESG), which is the amount the goverment adds annually if the subscriber has added funds as well.
3. The investment growth. This is the most interesting part for sure. It is the investment gain you may have achieved.

The government tracks every contribution and grant amount added on an individual basis regardless of the account type. 
Investment growth in a family account is fully available to every beneficiary without restriction.
Contributions and grant amounts associated with one beneficiary cannot be used by another beneficiary, while growth amounts can. 
This matters when it is time to withdraw funds.\

You can transfer RESP amounts to other RESP accounts in full or partial as much as you like, 
but only if the beneficiary is on both the sending and recieving accounts. 
The tracking of contribution and grant values cannot be bypassed, and all restrictions associated follow no matter how much you move the funds around.


## Withdrawing Funds for Education

This is the exciting time for both the subscribers and the beneficiary as they start a new chapter in their lives with advanced education. 
Starting classes there are expenses, bills to pay, laptops to buy. Tuition is sometimes paid up front but often delayed payment requirements by weeks which helps.
Surprise, you do not get access to the funds all at once and certainly not all of your funds. 

> This is where some people start not liking the RESP program depending on how much you have accumulated over the years.

There are different ways to withdraw funds from an RESP, for now we will focus on the methods common to this life stage. 
The government wants to ensure you actually attend class to receive the funds, 
so in the first 13 weeks you only have access to $8,000 for full time students and $4,000 for part time. Surprise!\

After the 13 week probation, and the beneficiary is still enrolled, access to the RESP opens up, sort of, almost, but yes. Lets first look at how to get the funds out.
Remember the 3 fund categories? The contributions went in as after tax dollars and yes, it comes out as after tax dollars. 
To withdraw the contributions is called the PSE (Post Secondary Education). 
To withdraw the grant funds is called the EAP (Educational Assistance Payment) which is taxable income to the beneficiary.
The remaining investment growth is withdrawn as EAP and is taxable income.

> There is a limit annually but not really a limit but good luck with that

There is plenty of documenation both government and 3rd party that claims there is no limit on withdrawing from your RESP accounts. Not true, sort of. 
While there is no limit, there is a barrier preventing more than $28,881 (as of 2025) for the year./

To withdraw more than the annual limit requires you asking for permission to access more. Here is where it gets weird. 
The government put the policing responsibily on the institution that holds your RESP account. 
That instituion decides if you are justified in getting the extra cash for your kid based on what you send them in writing, often requiring a budget. \

This is a good point to talk about what you can use the funds for and what you cannot. 
Funds can be used for tuition, books, electronics, food, rent, transportation, clothes, and general living. 
They cannot be used to buy property, vacation, and a buch of other things the CRA likely adjusts from time to time. 
This is important because while it is extremely unlikely any beneficiary using the annual limit will get auditied by the CRA, it is more likely to occur if you go beyond it.
Going beyond the limit is allowed and considered "unlimited" but must be justified and policed by the financial institution. 
If you get audited, you can bet the financial institution is going to draw the CRA's attention as well, so they are not usually motivated to help you.
